 However, if its like 5,7,15, it will show an ad, at 5th, 7th and 15th spin, than it starts over.
 I hope this is clear, so this a "multi function" object :). I've wrote a quite cool algorithm to manage it :D. Please change the numbers and keep the syntax. You can add any number inside the @[], but please use '@' before the number and seperate them with commas. Like @[@1,@9,@53,@422]
